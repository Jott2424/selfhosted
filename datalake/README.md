# Datalake

## This is my repo for all things running on my dell poweredge r720xd, as of writting this is only used for hosting my own cloud, which i use for data projects (datalake, data warehouse, cloud compute, etc...)

#### Note, i am having trouble getting nfs-kernel-server to run on proxmox so for now i am routing all of my files to the truenas server nfs share, but i will migrate this back over to the machine all of this is running on eventually.
