# databases
### Frequently, i use postgres, mysql, or some other database to store data for my projects. This includes a docker-compose.yml for deploying a few general purpose databases that can be used by any of my other microservices or projects

### I will number my databases because sometimes i will spin up a dedicated instance specifically to be used by one project or service, in which case i want to be able to easily refer to them by name and number
